{{HEAD_TO_HEAD_CONTEXT}}

You are playing ChainLex-1, a word association game. Give a one-word clue and number to maximize your score.

## Scoring
- Each correct guess earns points: 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt, etc. (triangular scoring)
- Maximum possible: 36 points (all 8 friendly words: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)
- Bystander: -5 points and ENDS your turn
- **Assassin: -28 points** (INSTANT CATASTROPHIC LOSS - AVOID AT ALL COSTS)

## CRITICAL: ASSASSIN AVOIDANCE IS YOUR TOP PRIORITY

⚠️ **BEFORE giving any clue, you MUST verify it does NOT associate with the ASSASSIN word.**

The guesser does NOT know which word is the assassin. If your clue could reasonably point to the assassin, the guesser WILL guess it and you WILL lose with -28 points.

**A safe clue that scores 2-3 points is infinitely better than a risky clue that hits the assassin or bystander.**

## Strategy
1. First, identify the ASSASSIN and think of words/concepts that relate to it
2. Then, find friendly word connections that DO NOT overlap with assassin associations
3. Only give a clue if you're confident it won't lead to the assassin
4. When in doubt, give a safer, smaller clue
5. **CRITICAL LESSON FROM PAST FAILURES**: Avoid overly broad or abstract clues like "FORMAL," "CUTE," or "COLLECTION" - these tend to unintentionally match bystander words. Instead, use highly specific, concrete clues that create narrow, unambiguous associations.

## Key Insights from Past Performance

### What Went Wrong
- **Overly broad clues fail**: "CUTE" connected to ELEPHANT (a bystander), "FORMAL" connected to SUIT (a bystander), "COLLECTION" connected to NOVEL (a bystander)
- **Abstract concepts are risky**: Words like "FORMAL," "CUTE," and "COLLECTION" are too general and create multiple valid associations across the board
- **Bystanders are often semantically close to friendly words**: The game is designed so bystanders share some characteristics with friendly words, making broad clues dangerous
- **Clues that seem safe can still hit bystanders**: "OBSERVE" hit PLANET (both scientific), "RULE" hit LION (both about dominance/power), "SWEET" hit CHOCOLATE (both sweet foods)
- **Adjectives and descriptors are particularly dangerous**: Adjectives like "SWEET," "OBSERVE," "RULE" create broad semantic fields that easily overlap with bystanders. Even when you think a clue is specific to friendly words, bystanders often share the same descriptive quality.
- **Common action words are deceptively risky**: Words like "PRESS," "ROUND," "MOTOR," "FUEL," and "TRANSMISSION" seem specific but have hidden associations with bystanders. For example:
  - "PRESS" unexpectedly connected to NAIL (you press/hammer nails)
  - "ROUND" unexpectedly connected to BALL (balls are round)
  - "MOTOR" unexpectedly connected to ROCKET (rockets have motors)
  - "FUEL" unexpectedly connected to PLANE and ROCKET (both use fuel)
  - "TRANSMISSION" unexpectedly connected to PLANE (planes have transmission systems)
- **Mechanical/technical clues often have broader applications than expected**: A clue you think applies only to cars/engines may also apply to aircraft, rockets, or other vehicles on the board
- **Spatial/shape descriptors are deceptive**: Words like "ROUND" seem to target specific words but can apply to many objects (balls, planets, etc.)
- **Clothing/appearance clues are high-risk**: Clues like "DRESS," "WEAR," "FORMAL," or "BUTTON" often have unintended overlaps with bystanders. For example, "BUTTON" connects to both COLLAR and SUIT, making it risky if SUIT is a bystander. Similarly, "DRESS" applies to both formal clothing items and SUIT.
- **Clues that seem specific to one object often apply to multiple objects**: For example, "LENS" might seem specific to GLASSES, but LAMP also has lenses. The guesser may guess the wrong word or miss the intended connection entirely.
- **Subtle or non-obvious associations often fail**: If a clue requires deep knowledge or non-obvious connections (e.g., "LENS" for LAMP), the guesser may not make the connection, resulting in underperformance.
- **Animal clues are deceptively risky**: "ANIMAL" seems like it should safely target animal words, but many animal-related bystanders exist on the board. For example, TIGER is often a bystander that would be hit by "ANIMAL."

### What Works Better
- **Use highly specific, concrete associations**: Instead of "FORMAL" for clothing, use something like "LAPEL" or "BUTTON" (if not on board) that creates a very narrow, specific connection
- **Prefer smaller, safer clues**: A clue connecting 2-3 words with zero ambiguity is better than a clue attempting 4+ words that risks hitting a bystander
- **Test your clue against ALL board words**: Before committing, mentally check if your clue could reasonably apply to any bystander or assassin word, not just friendly words. Consider:
  - Literal meanings (e.g., "ROUND" literally applies to BALL)
  - Functional associations (e.g., "MOTOR" applies to anything with an engine)
  - Metaphorical connections (e.g., "RULE" applies to dominance concepts)
  - Unexpected overlaps (e.g., "PRESS" applies to pressing nails, not just buttons)
  - Category overlaps (e.g., "ANIMAL" applies to all animals on the board, not just friendly ones)
- **Favor concrete nouns and specific verbs over adjectives and abstract concepts**: Concrete clues have fewer unintended associations
- **Avoid descriptive adjectives entirely**: Words like "SWEET," "SHARP," "POWERFUL," "SCIENTIFIC," "OBSERVE," "RULE," "DRESS," "WEAR," "FORMAL" are too prone to matching bystanders. Instead, use concrete nouns or very specific verbs that create narrow associations
- **Be extremely conservative with scoring targets**: Aim for 2-3 words with absolute certainty rather than 4+ words with moderate confidence. The -5 penalty for bystanders and -28 for assassins makes safety paramount
- **Avoid mechanical/technical clues that could apply to multiple vehicle types**: If your clue works for cars, check if it also works for planes, rockets, helicopters, or other vehicles on the board
- **Avoid shape/property descriptors**: Words like "ROUND," "SQUARE," "SMALL," "LARGE" often have unintended matches with bystanders
- **Avoid category-level clues**: Clues like "ANIMAL," "BUILDING," "TOOL," "STRUCTURE," or "CLOTHING" are too broad and will hit bystanders in the same category. Instead, target specific subcategories or use concrete nouns that are unique to friendly words
- **Use measurement units or technical specifications**: Clues like "CARAT" (for precious gems/metals) or "VOLT" (for electrical items) are highly specific and create narrow associations with low bystander risk
- **Prioritize obvious, direct associations**: The guesser needs to make the connection immediately. Avoid subtle or non-obvious associations that require specialized knowledge or deep thinking
- **Verify the clue works for ALL intended friendly words**: Before committing, ensure your clue actually applies to each friendly word you're targeting. For example, "LENS" applies to GLASSES but may not obviously apply to LAMP to most guessers

## Recommended Process

1. **ASSASSIN CHECK**: List 3-5 concepts/words that associate with the assassin
2. **BYSTANDER AWARENESS**: Explicitly consider which bystanders might accidentally match your clue. For EACH bystander, ask: "Could this clue reasonably apply to this word in ANY way?" If the answer is "maybe" or "yes," flag it as HIGH RISK
3. **FRIENDLY WORD ANALYSIS**: Identify the most specific, concrete connection among friendly words
4. **CLUE TESTING**: Ask yourself: "Could a guesser reasonably connect this clue to any bystander or assassin?" If yes, choose a different clue. Be especially suspicious of:
   - Clues that work for multiple vehicle types
   - Clues that describe physical properties or shapes
   - Clues that describe common actions or functions
   - Clues that could apply to multiple categories of objects
   - Clues that apply to entire categories (animals, buildings, tools, clothing, etc.)
   - Clues that require non-obvious or specialized knowledge
5. **CONSERVATIVE SCORING**: Prefer clues that connect 2-3 words with high confidence over clues that attempt 4+ words with moderate confidence
6. **AVOID ADJECTIVES**: Do not use adjectives or descriptive words. Use concrete nouns or specific verbs only
7. **CROSS-CHECK BYSTANDERS**: For each bystander, explicitly ask: "Does my clue apply to this word?" If the answer is "maybe" or "somewhat," reject the clue and try a different approach
8. **VERIFY MECHANICAL CLUES**: If your clue involves mechanical/technical concepts, verify it doesn't apply to other vehicles or machines on the board
9. **VERIFY PROPERTY CLUES**: If your clue describes a physical property, verify it doesn't literally apply to other objects on the board
10. **VERIFY CATEGORY CLUES**: If your clue targets a category (animals, buildings, clothing, etc.), verify it doesn't apply to bystanders in the same category. If it does, reject it and find a more specific clue
11. **VERIFY OBVIOUSNESS**: Ask yourself: "Would a typical guesser immediately understand this connection?" If the answer is "maybe" or "no," the clue is too subtle and will likely underperform

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Board: PASTA, PORT, SPY, YACHT, SALARY, CODE, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR
Friendly: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR, YACHT, CODE
Bystanders: PASTA, PORT, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, SALARY
Assassin: **SPY**

ASSASSIN CHECK: "SPY" associates with: secret, agent, CODE, intelligence, undercover, James Bond...
⚠️ WARNING: "CODE" is a friendly word but also strongly associates with SPY! 
Must avoid clues about secrecy, intelligence, or espionage.

Safe approach: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR are all animals/predators. 
"PREDATOR" or "ANIMAL" connects 6 words and has NO connection to SPY.

→ CLUE: PREDATOR, NUMBER: 6

**Example 2:**
Board: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, KEY, LAMP, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT, APPLE
Friendly: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, KEY, LAMP
Bystanders: BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT
Assassin: **APPLE**

ASSASSIN CHECK: "APPLE" associates with: fruit, red, tree, pie, iPhone, teacher, core, seed...
Must avoid clues about: fruit, food, technology (Apple Inc.), education, nature/trees.

Safe approach: PIANO, CLOCK, BELL, KEY all involve "keys" (piano keys, clock winding key, etc.)
"KEYS" has NO connection to APPLE.

→ CLUE: KEYS, NUMBER: 4

**Example 3 (Demonstrating Adjective Danger):**
Board: CAKE, BANANA, SUGAR, ORANGE, MUSEUM, ALBUM, CAMERA, BOOK, NOVEL, SONG, MONKEY, CHOCOLATE, MOVIE, FILM, MONUMENT
Friendly: CAKE, BANANA, SUGAR, ORANGE, MUSEUM, ALBUM, CAMERA, BOOK
Bystanders: NOVEL, SONG, MONKEY, CHOCOLATE, MOVIE, FILM, MONUMENT
Assassin: **MUSIC**

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "SWEET" as a clue
- Seems to target CAKE, BANANA, SUGAR, ORANGE
- BUT: CHOCOLATE is also sweet and is a bystander
- Result: Bystander hit on CHOCOLATE

✓ CORRECT APPROACH: Use a concrete noun instead
- "PEEL" connects BANANA and ORANGE specifically (things you peel), avoiding CHOCOLATE entirely
- This targets 2 words with high confidence rather than 4 words with assassination/bystander risk

**Example 4 (Demonstrating Mechanical Clue Danger):**
Board: ENGINE, GARAGE, HELICOPTER, CAR, KING, KNIGHT, CASTLE, QUEEN, KINGDOM, FORTRESS, PLANE, CHAMPION, ROCKET, PALACE, FACTORY, PLANET
Friendly: ENGINE, GARAGE, HELICOPTER, CAR, KING, KNIGHT, CASTLE, QUEEN
Bystanders: KINGDOM, FORTRESS, PLANE, CHAMPION, ROCKET, PALACE, FACTORY
Assassin: **PLANET**

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "FUEL" as a clue
- Seems to target ENGINE, CAR, HELICOPTER
- BUT: PLANE and ROCKET (both bystanders) also use fuel
- Result: Bystander hits

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "TRANSMISSION" as a clue
- Seems to target ENGINE, CAR, HELICOPTER, GARAGE
- BUT: PLANE (a bystander) also has transmission systems
- Result: Bystander hit

✓ CORRECT APPROACH: "COCKPIT" or "PILOT"
- Connects HELICOPTER and PLANE... wait, PLANE is a bystander
- Better: Focus on the medieval cluster instead with "THRONE" (KING, QUEEN) - only 2 words but very safe
- Or find a clue specific to ground vehicles only

**Example 5 (Demonstrating Property Descriptor Danger):**
Board: FIGHT, DEFEAT, BALL, GOAL, CHAMPION, BOXING, GAME, DANCE, BATTLE, MUSIC, TEAM, BOMB, VICTORY, REVOLUTION, WIN, PEACE
Friendly: REVOLUTION, DEFEAT, BOMB, PEACE, GAME, DANCE, BOXING, WIN
Bystanders: VICTORY, FIGHT, BATTLE, MUSIC, TEAM, GOAL, BALL
Assassin: **CHAMPION**

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "ROUND" as a clue
- Seems to target BOXING, GAME, DANCE, REVOLUTION
- BUT: BALL (a bystander) is literally round
- Result: Bystander hit on BALL

✓ CORRECT APPROACH: "GLOVES" or "RING"
- "GLOVES" connects BOXING and... (limited to 1-2 words)
- "RING" connects BOXING and... (limited to 1-2 words)
- Better: Find a clue that targets GAME, DANCE, PEACE without property descriptors

**Example 6 (Demonstrating Category Clue Danger):**
Board: HAMMER, SHOVEL, CANDLE, LAMP, NAIL, COLLAR, BUTTON, PIANO, MUSIC, TIE, NECK, EYE, GLASSES, SUIT, WEAPON, UNIFORM
Friendly: GLASSES, UNIFORM, TIE, COLLAR, LAMP, HAMMER, BUTTON, PIANO
Bystanders: MUSIC, NECK, CANDLE, EYE, NAIL, WEAPON, SUIT
Assassin: **SHOVEL**

ASSASSIN CHECK: "SHOVEL" associates with: digging, excavation, earth/ground, construction tools, burial, gardening, manual labor, dirt.

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "ANIMAL" as a clue
- Seems to target animal words
- BUT: TIGER (a bystander) is also an animal
- Result: Bystander hit on TIGER

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "TOOL" as a clue
- Seems to target HAMMER, SHOVEL
- BUT: SHOVEL is the assassin
- Result: Assassin hit

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "DRESS" as a clue
- Seems to target GLASSES, UNIFORM, TIE, COLLAR, BUTTON
- BUT: SUIT (a bystander) is also clothing/dress-related
- Result: Bystander hit on SUIT

❌ WRONG APPROACH: "LENS" as a clue
- Seems to target GLASSES and LAMP (both have lenses)
- BUT: The connection to LAMP is non-obvious and subtle
- Result: Underperformance - guesser may not make the connection

✓ CORRECT APPROACH: "KEYS" as a clue
- Connects PIANO (piano keys) specifically
- Only 1 word but very safe with zero bystander/assassin risk
- Alternative: Find a clue that connects 2-3 friendly words with obvious, direct associations
