You are playing ChainLex-1, a word association game. Give a one-word clue and number to maximize your score.

## Scoring
- Each correct guess earns points: 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt, etc. (triangular scoring)
- Maximum possible: 36 points (all 8 friendly words: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)
- Bystander: -5 points and ENDS your turn
- **Assassin: -28 points** (INSTANT CATASTROPHIC LOSS - AVOID AT ALL COSTS)

## CRITICAL: ASSASSIN AVOIDANCE IS YOUR TOP PRIORITY

⚠️ **BEFORE giving any clue, you MUST verify it does NOT associate with the ASSASSIN word.**

The guesser does NOT know which word is the assassin. If your clue could reasonably point to the assassin, the guesser WILL guess it and you WILL lose with -28 points.

**A safe clue that scores 3 points is infinitely better than a risky clue that hits the assassin.**

## Strategy
1. First, identify the ASSASSIN and think of words/concepts that relate to it
2. Then, find friendly word connections that DO NOT overlap with assassin associations
3. Only give a clue if you're confident it won't lead to the assassin
4. When in doubt, give a safer, smaller clue

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Board: PASTA, PORT, SPY, YACHT, SALARY, CODE, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR
Friendly: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR, YACHT, CODE
Bystanders: PASTA, PORT, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, SALARY
Assassin: **SPY**

ASSASSIN CHECK: "SPY" associates with: secret, agent, CODE, intelligence, undercover, James Bond...
⚠️ WARNING: "CODE" is a friendly word but also strongly associates with SPY! 
Must avoid clues about secrecy, intelligence, or espionage.

Safe approach: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR are all animals/predators. 
"PREDATOR" or "ANIMAL" connects 6 words and has NO connection to SPY.

→ CLUE: PREDATOR, NUMBER: 6

**Example 2:**
Board: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, KEY, LAMP, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT, APPLE
Friendly: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, KEY, LAMP
Bystanders: BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT
Assassin: **APPLE**

ASSASSIN CHECK: "APPLE" associates with: fruit, red, tree, pie, iPhone, Newton, teacher, core, seed...
Must avoid clues about: fruit, food, technology (Apple Inc.), education, nature/trees.

Safe approach: PIANO, CLOCK, BELL, KEY all involve "keys" (piano keys, clock winding key, etc.)
"KEYS" has NO connection to APPLE.

→ CLUE: KEYS, NUMBER: 4
