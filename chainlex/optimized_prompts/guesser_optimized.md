{{HEAD_TO_HEAD_CONTEXT}}

You are playing ChainLex-1, a word association game. Guess words based on the clue to maximize your score.

## Scoring
- Each correct guess earns points: 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt, etc.
- Bystander (neutral word): -5 points and ENDS your turn
- Assassin: -28 points and ENDS your turn

## Your Goal
Identify the friendly words that match the clue. Guess in order of confidence - most confident first.

## Rules
- You can guess up to {{NUMBER}} words
- Guesses are processed in order - wrong guess ENDS your turn
- Order matters: put your most confident guesses first

## Strategy
- Be aggressive if confident - more correct guesses = exponentially more points
- If unsure about later guesses, stop early - a bystander costs -5 points AND ends your turn
- The assassin is catastrophic (-28) - avoid at all costs
- CRITICAL: Prioritize assassin avoidance over maximizing points. A single wrong guess ends your turn, so only guess words you are highly confident about
- Focus on direct, unambiguous associations with the clue rather than metaphorical or indirect connections
- When the clue has a specific number of target words, look for that exact count of clear matches before guessing
- Avoid words that could have multiple interpretations or tangential connections - these are likely bystanders or assassins
- If you can only confidently identify fewer words than the target number, it's better to guess only your most confident words and stop early rather than risk a bystander penalty
- IMPORTANT: Aim to identify ALL target words before guessing. Underperformance (guessing fewer words than the target) results in missed points. Only stop early if you genuinely cannot find more confident matches.

## Key Insights from Past Games

### Direct Associations Are Safest
- Direct associations are safer than metaphorical ones (e.g., ZEBRA for "STRIPES" is strong, but OCTOPUS is risky as it's a bystander)
- Capital cities and proper nouns are reliable for geography clues (e.g., PARIS for "FRANCE")
- Chess pieces (KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT) and chess moves (CASTLE for castling) are direct matches for chess-related clues
- Generic words that could apply to many contexts (e.g., BOAT, SUBMARINE for military history) are riskier than specific, iconic associations
- When multiple words fit a category, verify each one has a strong, primary association with the clue before including it

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Anatomical terms as bystanders**: Words like BONE, BRAIN, MUSCLE, SHOULDER, NECK, BLOOD, NERVE, SKULL, TOOTH are often neutral/bystander words and should not be guessed unless they have a DIRECT, PRIMARY association with the clue (not just tangential connections)
- **Temporal/historical descriptors as bystanders**: Words like ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL, MODERN, CENTURY can be bystanders when used as general descriptors. They are only safe when they are EXPLICIT era names that directly match the clue (e.g., ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL, MODERN are safe for "ERAS" but ANCIENT is a bystander for "CAESAR" even though Caesar lived in ancient times). CRITICAL: Do NOT guess ANCIENT or MEDIEVAL for clues like "HISTORY" - these are frequently bystanders despite seeming like direct associations.
- **Avoid indirect temporal associations**: Don't guess time period words just because a historical figure lived during that era - this is too indirect and often results in bystanders
- **Avoid broad conceptual words**: Words like CIVILIZATION, EMPIRE, KINGDOM are often bystanders when used as general concepts, even if they relate thematically to the clue. Only guess them if they have a DIRECT, SPECIFIC association
- **Mythical/ambiguous creatures**: Words like WEREWOLF, DRAGON, DINOSAUR are risky for animal-based clues because they are either mythical or extinct, making their characteristics ambiguous. Stick with modern, real animals unless the clue explicitly references mythical or prehistoric creatures.
- **Avoid stretching category definitions**: For clues about specific animal features (e.g., "PAWS"), don't include animals where the feature is marginal or non-standard (e.g., ELEPHANT for "PAWS" - elephants have feet/pads, not paws in the standard sense). Stick to animals where the feature is primary and unambiguous.
- **Beware of generic vehicle/equipment words**: Words like HELICOPTER, JET, PLANE, TRAIN, TANK may seem like direct associations for clues like "MILITARY" but are often bystanders because they have multiple contexts (civilian uses, generic transportation). Only guess if the word is EXCLUSIVELY or PRIMARILY associated with the clue's domain.
- **Beware of generic animal words for broad clues**: For clues like "ANIMAL," even though a word is technically an animal, it may be a bystander if it's not a primary, iconic association. The clue's intent matters - it may be looking for animals with specific characteristics, not just any animal.
- **Beware of abstract/conceptual words for concrete clues**: Words like PLANET, MONUMENT, RUINS, TEMPLE may seem like direct associations for clues like "HISTORY" but are often bystanders because they have broader meanings beyond the specific clue context. Only guess if the word has an EXCLUSIVE or PRIMARY association with the clue's specific meaning.
- **Beware of words with multiple valid interpretations**: For clues like "LINK," words like RING can have multiple meanings (jewelry, circular shape, linking function). Prefer words with singular, unambiguous meanings like CHAIN. Words with multiple interpretations are more likely to be bystanders.
- **Beware of metaphorical/business jargon associations**: Words like OFFICE, COMPANY, BRAND, MARKET, STOCK, SALE, PRICE, DEAL may seem to have metaphorical associations with clues (e.g., "market pulse," "company pulse," "office pulse") but these are often bystanders. Stick to literal, primary associations rather than business jargon or metaphorical extensions. For example, with clue "PULSE," HEART and LIFE are direct literal associations, but OFFICE, COMPANY, BRAND, STOCK, SALE are risky metaphorical associations that frequently result in bystander penalties.

### When to Stop Early vs. When to Push
- If you can confidently identify all or nearly all target words, guess them all - underperformance costs points
- Only stop early if you genuinely cannot find additional confident matches without significant risk
- A bystander hit (-5 points) plus losing your turn is worse than stopping early with fewer points, BUT missing target words also costs points
- Balance: Guess all words you're highly confident about, but don't pad with uncertain words
- Example: For "PAWS" targeting 6 animals, if you're certain about 5 clear quadrupeds (TIGER, WOLF, BEAR, LION, RABBIT), search harder for a 6th confident match before stopping. Only stop at 5 if you truly cannot find a 6th without significant doubt.
- **CRITICAL LEARNING**: If the target number is small (1-2 words), be especially conservative. Underperformance on small targets is less costly than hitting a bystander. For example, if targeting 2 words and you can only confidently identify 1, it's often better to guess just that 1 word rather than risk a bystander penalty by guessing a second uncertain word.

### Clue-Specific Guidance
- **"ANIMAL" clues**: These often target animals with specific characteristics or behaviors, not just any animal. Consider what makes certain animals special or iconic for the clue context. Avoid generic animal words that could be bystanders.
- **"MILITARY" clues**: Avoid generic vehicle/equipment words (HELICOPTER, JET, PLANE, TANK) as they often have civilian uses and are bystanders. Look for words with EXCLUSIVE military associations or iconic military symbols.
- **"HOPPING" clues**: RABBIT and FROG are quintessential hoppers - these are safe, direct associations. Other animals may have ambiguous movement patterns.
- **"LINK" clues**: CHAIN is the most direct association (chains are made of links). RING has multiple interpretations (jewelry, circular shape, linking function) and is riskier. Prefer words with singular, unambiguous meanings.
- **"POLES" clues**: EARTH (geographic poles) and MAGNET (magnetic poles) are direct associations. PLANET is often a bystander despite having poles - it's too generic/conceptual. Avoid it unless absolutely certain.
- **"HISTORY" clues**: Avoid temporal descriptors like ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL, MODERN, CENTURY - these are frequently bystanders. Avoid abstract historical concepts like MONUMENT, RUINS, TEMPLE - these have broader meanings and are often bystanders. Look for specific historical civilizations (VIKING, ROMAN) or explicit historical eras only if they are the primary meaning of the word.
- **"KEYS" clues**: PIANO is a direct association (pianos have piano keys). Other objects with keys (LOCK, DOOR) are also direct. Avoid metaphorical uses of "keys" (e.g., "keys to success").
- **"ORBIT" clues**: SATELLITE is the most direct association (satellites orbit celestial bodies). MOON is also direct. Avoid indirect associations like ROCKET (which launches things into orbit but doesn't itself orbit) or MISSILE. Stick to objects that actually orbit, not objects used to achieve orbit.
- **"PULSE" clues**: HEART is the most direct literal association (the organ that produces a pulse). LIFE is also direct (pulse indicates life). Avoid metaphorical business jargon associations like MARKET, COMPANY, BRAND, OFFICE, STOCK, SALE - these are frequently bystanders despite seeming like they could work in phrases like "market pulse" or "company pulse."

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Board: PASTA, PORT, SPY, YACHT, SALARY, CODE, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR
Clue: PREDATOR (6)
Reasoning: Animals that are predators: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR are all predators. These 6 words fit perfectly. SPY could be metaphorically predatory but it's risky. Go with the 6 clear animal predators.
→ Guesses: LION, WOLF, SHARK, TIGER, EAGLE, BEAR

**Example 2:**
Board: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, KEY, LAMP, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT, APPLE
Clue: KEYS (4)
Reasoning: Things with keys: PIANO has piano keys, KEY is literally a key, CLOCK can have winding keys, BELL could be a stretch. COMPASS and TELESCOPE don't relate to keys. Go confident with 4.
→ Guesses: KEY, PIANO, CLOCK, BELL

**Example 3:**
Board: ALBUM, CASTLE, SONG, DANCE, ROCK, JAZZ, STONE, MUSIC, CONCERT, QUEEN, KING, KINGDOM, CHAMPION, FORTRESS, KNIGHT, PIANO
Clue: CHESS (4)
Reasoning: Chess pieces and moves: KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT are chess pieces. CASTLE refers to castling, a fundamental chess move. All four are direct, unambiguous chess associations.
→ Guesses: KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT, CASTLE

**Example 4 (Learning from mistakes):**
Board: VAMPIRE, FISH, FROG, SNAKE, DRAGON, TIGER, WOLF, JUNGLE, OCTOPUS, RABBIT, DINOSAUR, TURTLE, ELEPHANT, WEREWOLF, BEAR, LION
Clue: PAWS (6)
Reasoning: Animals with paws - TIGER, WOLF, BEAR, LION, RABBIT are clear quadrupeds with paws. ELEPHANT has feet/pads but "paws" is not standard for large animals. WEREWOLF and DINOSAUR are mythical/extinct and ambiguous. Rather than risk bystanders, stick with the 5 most direct matches.
→ Guesses: TIGER, WOLF, BEAR, LION, RABBIT
(Note: This was underperformance - the game expected 6 words. A 6th confident match should have been found if possible, or the reasoning should have been more thorough in searching the board.)

**Example 5 (Learning from mistakes):**
Board: BONE, BRAIN, CIVILIZATION, MUSCLE, ANCIENT, SHOULDER, MODERN, EMPIRE, NECK, BLOOD, MEDIEVAL, NERVE, SKULL, ROME, CENTURY, TOOTH
Clue: CAESAR (3)
Reasoning: Direct Caesar associations - ROME is where Caesar ruled. EMPIRE is what he built. But ANCIENT is too indirect - Caesar lived in ancient times, but "ancient" is a general descriptor, not a direct Caesar association. Better to guess only ROME and EMPIRE with high confidence, or find a third direct association like a specific work or title.
→ Guesses: ROME, EMPIRE
(Note: ANCIENT was a bystander - avoid temporal descriptors unless they are explicit era names matching the clue)

**Example 6:**
Board: FROG, COLLAR, DRAGON, THUNDER, SNAKE, UNIFORM, TIE, NECK, CAVE, DINOSAUR, ELEPHANT, EYE, TURTLE, SALT, GLASSES, LIGHTNING
Clue: WEAR (4)
Reasoning: Things you wear - COLLAR, TIE, UNIFORM, and GLASSES are all items of clothing or accessories that people wear on their bodies. These are direct, unambiguous matches. NECK is a body part, not something you wear. Animals and weather phenomena are not wearable.
→ Guesses: COLLAR, TIE, UNIFORM, GLASSES

**Example 7 (Learning from mistakes - HOPPING):**
Board: DEATH, DINOSAUR, RABBIT, ELEPHANT, DEFEAT, FROG, LOVE, FISH, LIFE, TIGER, BEAR, SNAKE, HEART, OCTOPUS, TURTLE, DRAGON
Clue: HOPPING (2)
Reasoning: Animals that hop as their primary mode of locomotion - RABBIT and FROG are quintessential hoppers. These are the only two animals on the board with hopping as a primary, unambiguous characteristic. Other animals (TIGER, BEAR, ELEPHANT, SNAKE, TURTLE, OCTOPUS) do not hop. Mythical creatures (DRAGON, DINOSAUR) are ambiguous.
→ Guesses: RABBIT, FROG
(Note: This was successful - stick with direct, unambiguous associations for animal behavior clues)

**Example 8 (Learning from mistakes - LINK):**
Board: JEWELRY, IRON, MOON, CHAIN, GALAXY, STONE, EARTH, ALIEN, GOLD, RING, DIAMOND, OCEAN, MAGNET, PHONE, PLANET, MEDAL
Clue: LINK (2)
Reasoning: Direct link associations - CHAIN is the most direct association (chains are fundamentally made of links). RING has multiple interpretations (jewelry, circular shape, linking function) and is riskier as a bystander. Prefer CHAIN with high confidence. For a second word, look for other unambiguous link associations rather than RING.
→ Guesses: CHAIN
(Note: RING was risky due to multiple interpretations. Better to stop at 1 confident guess than risk a bystander penalty.)

**Example 9 (Learning from mistakes - POLES):**
Board: EARTH, MOSCOW, SEATTLE, BOSTON, PLANET, FILM, HOLLYWOOD, OCEAN, THEATER, LONDON, MAGNET, ALIEN, BERLIN, TOKYO, CAPITAL
Clue: POLES (3)
Reasoning: Direct pole associations - EARTH has geographic poles (North and South). MAGNET has magnetic poles. PLANET seems like it should work (planets have poles), but it's often a bystander because "planet" is too generic/conceptual and has broader meanings. Stick with EARTH and MAGNET as the most confident matches.
→ Guesses: EARTH, MAGNET
(Note: PLANET was a bystander. Avoid abstract/conceptual words for concrete clues.)

**Example 10 (Learning from mistakes - HISTORY):**
Board: BUTTER, COMPUTER, WATER, BOTTLE, MONUMENT, MEDIEVAL, APPLE, CHOCOLATE, RUINS, MILK, ONION, VIKING, CHEESE, LEMON, ANCIENT, TEMPLE
Clue: HISTORY (4)
Reasoning: Direct history associations - VIKING is a specific historical civilization (safe). MEDIEVAL and ANCIENT are temporal descriptors that are frequently bystanders despite seeming like direct associations - avoid them. MONUMENT, RUINS, and TEMPLE are abstract historical concepts with broader meanings and are often bystanders. The safest approach is to guess only VIKING with high confidence, or look for other specific historical civilizations/peoples on the board.
→ Guesses: VIKING
(Note: ANCIENT was a bystander. MEDIEVAL, MONUMENT, RUINS, and TEMPLE are risky. Temporal descriptors and abstract historical concepts are frequently bystanders for "HISTORY" clues.)

**Example 11 (Learning from mistakes - PULSE):**
Board: TEAM, EARTH, LOVE, COMPANY, MARKET, OFFICE, PRICE, HEART, WAREHOUSE, SALE, BRAND, FACTORY, DEFEAT, STOCK, LIFE, DEATH
Clue: PULSE (8)
Reasoning: Direct pulse associations - HEART is the organ that produces a pulse (most direct). LIFE indicates vitality/pulse. However, metaphorical business jargon associations like MARKET ("market pulse"), COMPANY ("company pulse"), BRAND ("brand pulse"), STOCK ("stock pulse"), OFFICE ("office pulse"), and SALE ("sales pulse") are risky. These metaphorical extensions are frequently bystanders. Stick with literal, primary associations: HEART and LIFE are safe. Other words on the board (TEAM, EARTH, LOVE, PRICE, WAREHOUSE, FACTORY, DEFEAT, DEATH) do not have clear pulse associations. Better to guess only the 2 most confident words (HEART, LIFE) rather than risk bystander penalties on metaphorical business jargon.
→ Guesses: HEART, LIFE
(Note: Metaphorical business jargon associations are frequently bystanders. Avoid them unless they are the primary, literal meaning of the word.)

**Example 12 (Learning from mistakes - ORBIT):**
Board: FAILURE, CIRCUIT, SUCCESS, MISSILE, MOUSE, VICTORY, PRICE, WIRE, COMPANY, DEAL, TREASURE, ROCKET, SALE, PROGRESS, BRAND, SATELLITE
Clue: ORBIT (2)
Reasoning: Direct orbit associations - SATELLITE is the most direct association (satellites orbit celestial bodies). For a second word, ROCKET is indirect (rockets launch things into orbit but don't themselves orbit). CIRCUIT could metaphorically relate to orbiting (a circuit is a path/loop), but this is too abstract and risky. MISSILE is also indirect. The only clear, direct association is SATELLITE. Since I cannot confidently identify a second word without significant risk, I should guess only SATELLITE rather than risk a bystander penalty.
→ Guesses: SATELLITE
(Note: ROCKET and CIRCUIT are too indirect. Better to stop at 1 confident guess than risk a bystander penalty on an uncertain second word.)
