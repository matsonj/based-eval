Your goal is to provide a one-word clue and a number (1-8) that connects as many \"Friendly Words\" as possible while avoiding the \"Assassin\" and \"Bystanders.\"\n\n## Scoring & Risk Assessment\n- **Friendly Words:** 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt (Triangular scoring). Max: 36 pts.\n- **Bystander:** -5 points and ENDS turn. (Statistically the most common cause of failure).\n- **Assassin:** -28 points and INSTANT LOSS. (Absolute priority to avoid).\n\n## LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS FAILURES\n1. **The Tactical Gear Trap:** In Example 3, \"BASKETBALL\" hit \"ARMOR\" (Bystander). Why? Because in modern sports and gaming, \"Armor\" is often synonymous with protective gear (Knee pads, compression gear, Under Armour brand). \n   - *Lesson:* You must scan for \"Brand-Name Collocations\" and \"Sub-culture Synonyms.\"\n2. **The Partial Association:** A clue like \"JOINT\" might target \"KNEE,\" but if \"BONE\" is a bystander, the association is too high. \n   - *Lesson:* If a bystander is a constituent part or a direct synonym of a target word's category, the clue is invalid.\n3. **The \"Air\" Ambiguity:** \"AIR\" is highly volatile. It connects to sports (Air Jordan), geography (Island), and vehicles (Tires/Trucks).\n\n## REFINED THREE-FILTER TEST\n\n### 1. The Assassin Filter (Lethal)\nIdentify the Assassin word. Map its:\n- **Literal meanings** (e.g., AMAZON = River/Rainforest).\n- **Corporate/Modern meanings** (e.g., AMAZON = Shipping, Kindle, Prime).\n- **Mythological meanings** (e.g., AMAZON = Warrior).\nDiscard any clue within 2 degrees of separation.\n\n### 2. The Bystander Filter (The \"Turn-Killer\")\nYou must perform an **Adversarial Scan** for every Bystander:\n- **Brand/Commercial Check:** Does the clue and bystander form a brand name? (e.g., Under + Armor, Six + Pack).\n- **Functional Overlap:** Does the bystander perform a similar function to a target? (e.g., Target: TRUCK, Bystander: VAN; Clue: \"ENGINE\" is too risky).\n- **Compound Word Check:** (e.g., Clue: \"BALL\", Bystander: \"SAW\" -> \"Bandsaw\" is a stretch, but \"Sawdust\" vs \"Ballpark\" is the level of scrutiny required).\n\n### 3. Strength-to-Risk Ratio\n- **1-2 Words:** Use when the board is \"dirty\" (many bystanders with overlapping themes).\n- **3-4 Words:** Use only for \"Hard Categories\" (e.g., Elements, Planets, Body Parts).\n- Avoid \"Abstract Vibe\" clues (e.g., \"HAPPINESS\" for \"SUN\") as they are subjective and likely to hit bystanders.\n\n## Reasoning Framework\nYou must document your thought process using the following structure:\n\n**ASSASSIN CHECK:** List the Assassin word and its \"Danger Zones\" (Themes/Brands/Idioms).\n**BYSTANDER SCAN:** \n- List every Bystander.\n- For your chosen clue, perform the \"Adversarial Scan\" (Brand/Functional/Compound) against the bystanders. \n- *Crucial:* Explain why a bystander that *seems* related (like ARMOR to BASKETBALL) is or isn't a threat.\n\n**REASONING:** \n- List Targeted Friendly Words.\n- Explain the connection.\n- **Negative Selection:** Why does this clue exclude the specific bystanders on this board?\n\n**CURRENT GAME DATA**\nBoard: {{BOARD}}\nFriendly Words: {{FRIENDLY_WORDS}}\nBystanders: {{BYSTANDERS}}\nAssassin: {{ASSASSIN}}\n\n**Response Format:**\nASSASSIN CHECK: [assassin word] -> [danger zones]\nBYSTANDER SCAN: [clue] vs [bystander list]. [Specific exclusion logic].\nREASONING: [Targets] -> [Connection]. \nCLUE: [one word]\nNUMBER: [1-8]",

      "instructions": "You are playing ChainLex-1, a word association game. Guess words based on the clue to maximize your score.\n\n## Scoring\n- Each correct guess earns points: 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt, etc.\n- Bystander (neutral word): -5 points and ENDS your turn\n- Assassin: -28 points and ENDS your turn\n\n## Your Goal\nIdentify the friendly words that match the clue. Guess in order of confidence - most confident first.\n\n## Rules\n- You can guess up to NUMBER + 1 words (plus-one rule)\n- Guesses are processed in order - wrong guess ENDS your turn\n- Order matters: put your most confident guesses first\n\n## Strategy\n- Be aggressive if confident - more correct guesses = exponentially more points\n- If unsure about later guesses, stop early - a bystander costs -5 points AND ends your turn\n- The assassin is catastrophic (-28) - avoid at all costs\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\nBoard: PASTA, PORT, SPY, YACHT, SALARY, CODE, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR\nClue: PREDATOR (6)\nReasoning: Animals that are predators: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR are all predators. These 6 words fit perfectly. SPY could be metaphorically predatory but it's risky. Go with the 6 clear animal predators.\n→ Guesses: LION, WOLF, SHARK, TIGER, EAGLE, BEAR\n\n**Example 2:**\nBoard: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, KEY, LAMP, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT, APPLE\nClue: KEYS (4)\nReasoning: Things with keys: PIANO has piano keys, KEY is literally a key, CLOCK can have winding keys, BELL could be a stretch. COMPASS and TELESCOPE don't relate to keys. Go confident with 4.\n→ Guesses: KEY, PIANO, CLOCK, BELL\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT GAME\n\n**Available Words (unrevealed):** {{AVAILABLE_WORDS}}\n\n**Board Layout:**\n{{BOARD}}\n\n**Current Clue:** {{CLUE}} ({{NUMBER}})\n\n**List your guesses, one word per line. Most confident first. Only choose from available words above.**",
