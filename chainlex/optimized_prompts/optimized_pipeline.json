      "instructions": "You are playing ChainLex-1, a word association game. Give a one-word clue and number to maximize your score.\n\n## Scoring\n- Each correct guess earns points: 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt, etc. (triangular scoring)\n- Maximum possible: 36 points (all 8 friendly words: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)\n- Bystander: -5 points and ENDS your turn\n- **Assassin: -28 points** (INSTANT CATASTROPHIC LOSS - AVOID AT ALL COSTS)\n\n## CRITICAL: ASSASSIN AVOIDANCE IS YOUR TOP PRIORITY\n\n⚠️ **BEFORE giving any clue, you MUST verify it does NOT associate with the ASSASSIN word.**\n\nThe guesser does NOT know which word is the assassin. If your clue could reasonably point to the assassin, the guesser WILL guess it and you WILL lose with -28 points.\n\n**A safe clue that scores 2-3 points is infinitely better than a risky clue that hits the assassin or bystander.**\n\n## Strategy\n1. First, identify the ASSASSIN and think of words/concepts that relate to it\n2. Then, find friendly word connections that DO NOT overlap with assassin associations\n3. Only give a clue if you're confident it won't lead to the assassin\n4. When in doubt, give a safer, smaller clue\n5. **CRITICAL LESSON FROM PAST FAILURES**: Avoid overly broad or abstract clues like \"FORMAL,\" \"CUTE,\" or \"COLLECTION\" - these tend to unintentionally match bystander words. Instead, use highly specific, concrete clues that create narrow, unambiguous associations.\n\n## Key Insights from Past Performance\n\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Overly broad clues fail**: \"CUTE\" connected to ELEPHANT (a bystander), \"FORMAL\" connected to SUIT (a bystander), \"COLLECTION\" connected to NOVEL (a bystander)\n- **Abstract concepts are risky**: Words like \"FORMAL,\" \"CUTE,\" and \"COLLECTION\" are too general and create multiple valid associations across the board\n- **Bystanders are often semantically close to friendly words**: The game is designed so bystanders share some characteristics with friendly words, making broad clues dangerous\n- **Clues that seem safe can still hit bystanders**: \"OBSERVE\" hit PLANET (both scientific), \"RULE\" hit LION (both about dominance/power), \"SWEET\" hit CHOCOLATE (both sweet foods)\n- **Adjectives and descriptors are particularly dangerous**: Adjectives like \"SWEET,\" \"OBSERVE,\" \"RULE\" create broad semantic fields that easily overlap with bystanders. Even when you think a clue is specific to friendly words, bystanders often share the same descriptive quality.\n- **Common action words are deceptively risky**: Words like \"PRESS,\" \"ROUND,\" \"MOTOR,\" \"FUEL,\" and \"TRANSMISSION\" seem specific but have hidden associations with bystanders. For example:\n  - \"PRESS\" unexpectedly connected to NAIL (you press/hammer nails)\n  - \"ROUND\" unexpectedly connected to BALL (balls are round)\n  - \"MOTOR\" unexpectedly connected to ROCKET (rockets have motors)\n  - \"FUEL\" unexpectedly connected to PLANE and ROCKET (both use fuel)\n  - \"TRANSMISSION\" unexpectedly connected to PLANE (planes have transmission systems)\n- **Mechanical/technical clues often have broader applications than expected**: A clue you think applies only to cars/engines may also apply to aircraft, rockets, or other vehicles on the board\n- **Spatial/shape descriptors are deceptive**: Words like \"ROUND\" seem to target specific words but can apply to many objects (balls, planets, etc.)\n- **Clothing/appearance clues are high-risk**: Clues like \"DRESS,\" \"WEAR,\" \"FORMAL,\" or \"BUTTON\" often have unintended overlaps with bystanders. For example, \"BUTTON\" connects to both COLLAR and SUIT, making it risky if SUIT is a bystander. Similarly, \"DRESS\" applies to both formal clothing items and SUIT.\n- **Clues that seem specific to one object often apply to multiple objects**: For example, \"LENS\" might seem specific to GLASSES, but LAMP also has lenses. The guesser may guess the wrong word or miss the intended connection entirely.\n- **Subtle or non-obvious associations often fail**: If a clue requires deep knowledge or non-obvious connections (e.g., \"LENS\" for LAMP), the guesser may not make the connection, resulting in underperformance.\n- **Animal clues are deceptively risky**: \"ANIMAL\" seems like it should safely target animal words, but many animal-related bystanders exist on the board. For example, TIGER is often a bystander that would be hit by \"ANIMAL.\"\n\n### What Works Better\n- **Use highly specific, concrete associations**: Instead of \"FORMAL\" for clothing, use something like \"LAPEL\" or \"BUTTON\" (if not on board) that creates a very narrow, specific connection\n- **Prefer smaller, safer clues**: A clue connecting 2-3 words with zero ambiguity is better than a clue attempting 4+ words that risks hitting a bystander\n- **Test your clue against ALL board words**: Before committing, mentally check if your clue could reasonably apply to any bystander or assassin word, not just friendly words. Consider:\n  - Literal meanings (e.g., \"ROUND\" literally applies to BALL)\n  - Functional associations (e.g., \"MOTOR\" applies to anything with an engine)\n  - Metaphorical connections (e.g., \"RULE\" applies to dominance concepts)\n  - Unexpected overlaps (e.g., \"PRESS\" applies to pressing nails, not just buttons)\n  - Category overlaps (e.g., \"ANIMAL\" applies to all animals on the board, not just friendly ones)\n- **Favor concrete nouns and specific verbs over adjectives and abstract concepts**: Concrete clues have fewer unintended associations\n- **Avoid descriptive adjectives entirely**: Words like \"SWEET,\" \"SHARP,\" \"POWERFUL,\" \"SCIENTIFIC,\" \"OBSERVE,\" \"RULE,\" \"DRESS,\" \"WEAR,\" \"FORMAL\" are too prone to matching bystanders. Instead, use concrete nouns or very specific verbs that create narrow associations\n- **Be extremely conservative with scoring targets**: Aim for 2-3 words with absolute certainty rather than 4+ words with moderate confidence. The -5 penalty for bystanders and -28 for assassins makes safety paramount\n- **Avoid mechanical/technical clues that could apply to multiple vehicle types**: If your clue works for cars, check if it also works for planes, rockets, helicopters, or other vehicles on the board\n- **Avoid shape/property descriptors**: Words like \"ROUND,\" \"SQUARE,\" \"SMALL,\" \"LARGE\" often have unintended matches with bystanders\n- **Avoid category-level clues**: Clues like \"ANIMAL,\" \"BUILDING,\" \"TOOL,\" \"STRUCTURE,\" or \"CLOTHING\" are too broad and will hit bystanders in the same category. Instead, target specific subcategories or use concrete nouns that are unique to friendly words\n- **Use measurement units or technical specifications**: Clues like \"CARAT\" (for precious gems/metals) or \"VOLT\" (for electrical items) are highly specific and create narrow associations with low bystander risk\n- **Prioritize obvious, direct associations**: The guesser needs to make the connection immediately. Avoid subtle or non-obvious associations that require specialized knowledge or deep thinking\n- **Verify the clue works for ALL intended friendly words**: Before committing, ensure your clue actually applies to each friendly word you're targeting. For example, \"LENS\" applies to GLASSES but may not obviously apply to LAMP to most guessers\n\n## Recommended Process\n\n1. **ASSASSIN CHECK**: List 3-5 concepts/words that associate with the assassin\n2. **BYSTANDER AWARENESS**: Explicitly consider which bystanders might accidentally match your clue. For EACH bystander, ask: \"Could this clue reasonably apply to this word in ANY way?\" If the answer is \"maybe\" or \"yes,\" flag it as HIGH RISK\n3. **FRIENDLY WORD ANALYSIS**: Identify the most specific, concrete connection among friendly words\n4. **CLUE TESTING**: Ask yourself: \"Could a guesser reasonably connect this clue to any bystander or assassin?\" If yes, choose a different clue. Be especially suspicious of:\n   - Clues that work for multiple vehicle types\n   - Clues that describe physical properties or shapes\n   - Clues that describe common actions or functions\n   - Clues that could apply to multiple categories of objects\n   - Clues that apply to entire categories (animals, buildings, tools, clothing, etc.)\n   - Clues that require non-obvious or specialized knowledge\n5. **CONSERVATIVE SCORING**: Prefer clues that connect 2-3 words with high confidence over clues that attempt 4+ words with moderate confidence\n6. **AVOID ADJECTIVES**: Do not use adjectives or descriptive words. Use concrete nouns or specific verbs only\n7. **CROSS-CHECK BYSTANDERS**: For each bystander, explicitly ask: \"Does my clue apply to this word?\" If the answer is \"maybe\" or \"somewhat,\" reject the clue and try a different approach\n8. **VERIFY MECHANICAL CLUES**: If your clue involves mechanical/technical concepts, verify it doesn't apply to other vehicles or machines on the board\n9. **VERIFY PROPERTY CLUES**: If your clue describes a physical property, verify it doesn't literally apply to other objects on the board\n10. **VERIFY CATEGORY CLUES**: If your clue targets a category (animals, buildings, clothing, etc.), verify it doesn't apply to bystanders in the same category. If it does, reject it and find a more specific clue\n11. **VERIFY OBVIOUSNESS**: Ask yourself: \"Would a typical guesser immediately understand this connection?\" If the answer is \"maybe\" or \"no,\" the clue is too subtle and will likely underperform\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\nBoard: PASTA, PORT, SPY, YACHT, SALARY, CODE, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR\nFriendly: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR, YACHT, CODE\nBystanders: PASTA, PORT, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, SALARY\nAssassin: **SPY**\n\nASSASSIN CHECK: \"SPY\" associates with: secret, agent, CODE, intelligence, undercover, James Bond...\n⚠️ WARNING: \"CODE\" is a friendly word but also strongly associates with SPY! \nMust avoid clues about secrecy, intelligence, or espionage.\n\nSafe approach: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR are all animals/predators. \n\"PREDATOR\" or \"ANIMAL\" connects 6 words and has NO connection to SPY.\n\n→ CLUE: PREDATOR, NUMBER: 6\n\n**Example 2:**\nBoard: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, KEY, LAMP, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT, APPLE\nFriendly: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, KEY, LAMP\nBystanders: BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT\nAssassin: **APPLE**\n\nASSASSIN CHECK: \"APPLE\" associates with: fruit, red, tree, pie, iPhone, teacher, core, seed...\nMust avoid clues about: fruit, food, technology (Apple Inc.), education, nature/trees.\n\nSafe approach: PIANO, CLOCK, BELL, KEY all involve \"keys\" (piano keys, clock winding key, etc.)\n\"KEYS\" has NO connection to APPLE.\n\n→ CLUE: KEYS, NUMBER: 4\n\n**Example 3 (Demonstrating Adjective Danger):**\nBoard: CAKE, BANANA, SUGAR, ORANGE, MUSEUM, ALBUM, CAMERA, BOOK, NOVEL, SONG, MONKEY, CHOCOLATE, MOVIE, FILM, MONUMENT\nFriendly: CAKE, BANANA, SUGAR, ORANGE, MUSEUM, ALBUM, CAMERA, BOOK\nBystanders: NOVEL, SONG, MONKEY, CHOCOLATE, MOVIE, FILM, MONUMENT\nAssassin: **MUSIC**\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"SWEET\" as a clue\n- Seems to target CAKE, BANANA, SUGAR, ORANGE\n- BUT: CHOCOLATE is also sweet and is a bystander\n- Result: Bystander hit on CHOCOLATE\n\n✓ CORRECT APPROACH: Use a concrete noun instead\n- \"PEEL\" connects BANANA and ORANGE specifically (things you peel), avoiding CHOCOLATE entirely\n- This targets 2 words with high confidence rather than 4 words with assassination/bystander risk\n\n**Example 4 (Demonstrating Mechanical Clue Danger):**\nBoard: ENGINE, GARAGE, HELICOPTER, CAR, KING, KNIGHT, CASTLE, QUEEN, KINGDOM, FORTRESS, PLANE, CHAMPION, ROCKET, PALACE, FACTORY, PLANET\nFriendly: ENGINE, GARAGE, HELICOPTER, CAR, KING, KNIGHT, CASTLE, QUEEN\nBystanders: KINGDOM, FORTRESS, PLANE, CHAMPION, ROCKET, PALACE, FACTORY\nAssassin: **PLANET**\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"FUEL\" as a clue\n- Seems to target ENGINE, CAR, HELICOPTER\n- BUT: PLANE and ROCKET (both bystanders) also use fuel\n- Result: Bystander hits\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"TRANSMISSION\" as a clue\n- Seems to target ENGINE, CAR, HELICOPTER, GARAGE\n- BUT: PLANE (a bystander) also has transmission systems\n- Result: Bystander hit\n\n✓ CORRECT APPROACH: \"COCKPIT\" or \"PILOT\"\n- Connects HELICOPTER and PLANE... wait, PLANE is a bystander\n- Better: Focus on the medieval cluster instead with \"THRONE\" (KING, QUEEN) - only 2 words but very safe\n- Or find a clue specific to ground vehicles only\n\n**Example 5 (Demonstrating Property Descriptor Danger):**\nBoard: FIGHT, DEFEAT, BALL, GOAL, CHAMPION, BOXING, GAME, DANCE, BATTLE, MUSIC, TEAM, BOMB, VICTORY, REVOLUTION, WIN, PEACE\nFriendly: REVOLUTION, DEFEAT, BOMB, PEACE, GAME, DANCE, BOXING, WIN\nBystanders: VICTORY, FIGHT, BATTLE, MUSIC, TEAM, GOAL, BALL\nAssassin: **CHAMPION**\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"ROUND\" as a clue\n- Seems to target BOXING, GAME, DANCE, REVOLUTION\n- BUT: BALL (a bystander) is literally round\n- Result: Bystander hit on BALL\n\n✓ CORRECT APPROACH: \"GLOVES\" or \"RING\"\n- \"GLOVES\" connects BOXING and... (limited to 1-2 words)\n- \"RING\" connects BOXING and... (limited to 1-2 words)\n- Better: Find a clue that targets GAME, DANCE, PEACE without property descriptors\n\n**Example 6 (Demonstrating Category Clue Danger):**\nBoard: HAMMER, SHOVEL, CANDLE, LAMP, NAIL, COLLAR, BUTTON, PIANO, MUSIC, TIE, NECK, EYE, GLASSES, SUIT, WEAPON, UNIFORM\nFriendly: GLASSES, UNIFORM, TIE, COLLAR, LAMP, HAMMER, BUTTON, PIANO\nBystanders: MUSIC, NECK, CANDLE, EYE, NAIL, WEAPON, SUIT\nAssassin: **SHOVEL**\n\nASSASSIN CHECK: \"SHOVEL\" associates with: digging, excavation, earth/ground, construction tools, burial, gardening, manual labor, dirt.\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"ANIMAL\" as a clue\n- Seems to target animal words\n- BUT: TIGER (a bystander) is also an animal\n- Result: Bystander hit on TIGER\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"TOOL\" as a clue\n- Seems to target HAMMER, SHOVEL\n- BUT: SHOVEL is the assassin\n- Result: Assassin hit\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"DRESS\" as a clue\n- Seems to target GLASSES, UNIFORM, TIE, COLLAR, BUTTON\n- BUT: SUIT (a bystander) is also clothing/dress-related\n- Result: Bystander hit on SUIT\n\n❌ WRONG APPROACH: \"LENS\" as a clue\n- Seems to target GLASSES and LAMP (both have lenses)\n- BUT: The connection to LAMP is non-obvious and subtle\n- Result: Underperformance - guesser may not make the connection\n\n✓ CORRECT APPROACH: \"KEYS\" as a clue\n- Connects PIANO (piano keys) specifically\n- Only 1 word but very safe with zero bystander/assassin risk\n- Alternative: Find a clue that connects 2-3 friendly words with obvious, direct associations\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT GAME\n\n**Board (16 words):** {{BOARD}}\n\n**Your Friendly Words ({{NUM_FRIENDLY}}):** {{FRIENDLY_WORDS}}\n**Bystanders:** {{BYSTANDERS}}\n**⚠️ ASSASSIN (AVOID AT ALL COSTS):** {{ASSASSIN}}\n\n**Your response MUST include:**\n1.

      "instructions": "You are playing ChainLex-1, a word association game. Guess words based on the clue to maximize your score.\n\n## Scoring\n- Each correct guess earns points: 1st=1pt, 2nd=2pt, 3rd=3pt, etc.\n- Bystander (neutral word): -5 points and ENDS your turn\n- Assassin: -28 points and ENDS your turn\n\n## Your Goal\nIdentify the friendly words that match the clue. Guess in order of confidence - most confident first.\n\n## Rules\n- You can guess up to {{NUMBER}} words\n- Guesses are processed in order - wrong guess ENDS your turn\n- Order matters: put your most confident guesses first\n\n## Strategy\n- Be aggressive if confident - more correct guesses = exponentially more points\n- If unsure about later guesses, stop early - a bystander costs -5 points AND ends your turn\n- The assassin is catastrophic (-28) - avoid at all costs\n- CRITICAL: Prioritize assassin avoidance over maximizing points. A single wrong guess ends your turn, so only guess words you are highly confident about\n- Focus on direct, unambiguous associations with the clue rather than metaphorical or indirect connections\n- When the clue has a specific number of target words, look for that exact count of clear matches before guessing\n- Avoid words that could have multiple interpretations or tangential connections - these are likely bystanders or assassins\n- If you can only confidently identify fewer words than the target number, it's better to guess only your most confident words and stop early rather than risk a bystander penalty\n- IMPORTANT: Aim to identify ALL target words before guessing. Underperformance (guessing fewer words than the target) results in missed points. Only stop early if you genuinely cannot find more confident matches.\n\n## Key Insights from Past Games\n\n### Direct Associations Are Safest\n- Direct associations are safer than metaphorical ones (e.g., ZEBRA for \"STRIPES\" is strong, but OCTOPUS is risky as it's a bystander)\n- Capital cities and proper nouns are reliable for geography clues (e.g., PARIS for \"FRANCE\")\n- Chess pieces (KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT) and chess moves (CASTLE for castling) are direct matches for chess-related clues\n- Generic words that could apply to many contexts (e.g., BOAT, SUBMARINE for military history) are riskier than specific, iconic associations\n- When multiple words fit a category, verify each one has a strong, primary association with the clue before including it\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- **Anatomical terms as bystanders**: Words like BONE, BRAIN, MUSCLE, SHOULDER, NECK, BLOOD, NERVE, SKULL, TOOTH are often neutral/bystander words and should not be guessed unless they have a DIRECT, PRIMARY association with the clue (not just tangential connections)\n- **Temporal/historical descriptors as bystanders**: Words like ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL, MODERN, CENTURY can be bystanders when used as general descriptors. They are only safe when they are EXPLICIT era names that directly match the clue (e.g., ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL, MODERN are safe for \"ERAS\" but ANCIENT is a bystander for \"CAESAR\" even though Caesar lived in ancient times). CRITICAL: Do NOT guess ANCIENT or MEDIEVAL for clues like \"HISTORY\" - these are frequently bystanders despite seeming like direct associations.\n- **Avoid indirect temporal associations**: Don't guess time period words just because a historical figure lived during that era - this is too indirect and often results in bystanders\n- **Avoid broad conceptual words**: Words like CIVILIZATION, EMPIRE, KINGDOM are often bystanders when used as general concepts, even if they relate thematically to the clue. Only guess them if they have a DIRECT, SPECIFIC association\n- **Mythical/ambiguous creatures**: Words like WEREWOLF, DRAGON, DINOSAUR are risky for animal-based clues because they are either mythical or extinct, making their characteristics ambiguous. Stick with modern, real animals unless the clue explicitly references mythical or prehistoric creatures.\n- **Avoid stretching category definitions**: For clues about specific animal features (e.g., \"PAWS\"), don't include animals where the feature is marginal or non-standard (e.g., ELEPHANT for \"PAWS\" - elephants have feet/pads, not paws in the standard sense). Stick to animals where the feature is primary and unambiguous.\n- **Beware of generic vehicle/equipment words**: Words like HELICOPTER, JET, PLANE, TRAIN, TANK may seem like direct associations for clues like \"MILITARY\" but are often bystanders because they have multiple contexts (civilian uses, generic transportation). Only guess if the word is EXCLUSIVELY or PRIMARILY associated with the clue's domain.\n- **Beware of generic animal words for broad clues**: For clues like \"ANIMAL,\" even though a word is technically an animal, it may be a bystander if it's not a primary, iconic association. The clue's intent matters - it may be looking for animals with specific characteristics, not just any animal.\n- **Beware of abstract/conceptual words for concrete clues**: Words like PLANET, MONUMENT, RUINS, TEMPLE may seem like direct associations for clues like \"HISTORY\" but are often bystanders because they have broader meanings beyond the specific clue context. Only guess if the word has an EXCLUSIVE or PRIMARY association with the clue's specific meaning.\n- **Beware of words with multiple valid interpretations**: For clues like \"LINK,\" words like RING can have multiple meanings (jewelry, circular shape, linking function). Prefer words with singular, unambiguous meanings like CHAIN. Words with multiple interpretations are more likely to be bystanders.\n- **Beware of metaphorical/business jargon associations**: Words like OFFICE, COMPANY, BRAND, MARKET, STOCK, SALE, PRICE, DEAL may seem to have metaphorical associations with clues (e.g., \"market pulse,\" \"company pulse,\" \"office pulse\") but these are often bystanders. Stick to literal, primary associations rather than business jargon or metaphorical extensions. For example, with clue \"PULSE,\" HEART and LIFE are direct literal associations, but OFFICE, COMPANY, BRAND, STOCK, SALE are risky metaphorical associations that frequently result in bystander penalties.\n\n### When to Stop Early vs. When to Push\n- If you can confidently identify all or nearly all target words, guess them all - underperformance costs points\n- Only stop early if you genuinely cannot find additional confident matches without significant risk\n- A bystander hit (-5 points) plus losing your turn is worse than stopping early with fewer points, BUT missing target words also costs points\n- Balance: Guess all words you're highly confident about, but don't pad with uncertain words\n- Example: For \"PAWS\" targeting 6 animals, if you're certain about 5 clear quadrupeds (TIGER, WOLF, BEAR, LION, RABBIT), search harder for a 6th confident match before stopping. Only stop at 5 if you truly cannot find a 6th without significant doubt.\n- **CRITICAL LEARNING**: If the target number is small (1-2 words), be especially conservative. Underperformance on small targets is less costly than hitting a bystander. For example, if targeting 2 words and you can only confidently identify 1, it's often better to guess just that 1 word rather than risk a bystander penalty by guessing a second uncertain word.\n\n### Clue-Specific Guidance\n- **\"ANIMAL\" clues**: These often target animals with specific characteristics or behaviors, not just any animal. Consider what makes certain animals special or iconic for the clue context. Avoid generic animal words that could be bystanders.\n- **\"MILITARY\" clues**: Avoid generic vehicle/equipment words (HELICOPTER, JET, PLANE, TANK) as they often have civilian uses and are bystanders. Look for words with EXCLUSIVE military associations or iconic military symbols.\n- **\"HOPPING\" clues**: RABBIT and FROG are quintessential hoppers - these are safe, direct associations. Other animals may have ambiguous movement patterns.\n- **\"LINK\" clues**: CHAIN is the most direct association (chains are made of links). RING has multiple interpretations (jewelry, circular shape, linking function) and is riskier. Prefer words with singular, unambiguous meanings.\n- **\"POLES\" clues**: EARTH (geographic poles) and MAGNET (magnetic poles) are direct associations. PLANET is often a bystander despite having poles - it's too generic/conceptual. Avoid it unless absolutely certain.\n- **\"HISTORY\" clues**: Avoid temporal descriptors like ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL, MODERN, CENTURY - these are frequently bystanders. Avoid abstract historical concepts like MONUMENT, RUINS, TEMPLE - these have broader meanings and are often bystanders. Look for specific historical civilizations (VIKING, ROMAN) or explicit historical eras only if they are the primary meaning of the word.\n- **\"KEYS\" clues**: PIANO is a direct association (pianos have piano keys). Other objects with keys (LOCK, DOOR) are also direct. Avoid metaphorical uses of \"keys\" (e.g., \"keys to success\").\n- **\"ORBIT\" clues**: SATELLITE is the most direct association (satellites orbit celestial bodies). MOON is also direct. Avoid indirect associations like ROCKET (which launches things into orbit but doesn't itself orbit) or MISSILE. Stick to objects that actually orbit, not objects used to achieve orbit.\n- **\"PULSE\" clues**: HEART is the most direct literal association (the organ that produces a pulse). LIFE is also direct (pulse indicates life). Avoid metaphorical business jargon associations like MARKET, COMPANY, BRAND, OFFICE, STOCK, SALE - these are frequently bystanders despite seeming like they could work in phrases like \"market pulse\" or \"company pulse.\"\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\nBoard: PASTA, PORT, SPY, YACHT, SALARY, CODE, FORTRESS, CHEESE, BRACELET, TRAIL, LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR\nClue: PREDATOR (6)\nReasoning: Animals that are predators: LION, WOLF, EAGLE, SHARK, TIGER, BEAR are all predators. These 6 words fit perfectly. SPY could be metaphorically predatory but it's risky. Go with the 6 clear animal predators.\n→ Guesses: LION, WOLF, SHARK, TIGER, EAGLE, BEAR\n\n**Example 2:**\nBoard: PIANO, MIRROR, CROWN, DIAMOND, CLOCK, BELL, BOOK, TELESCOPE, COMPASS, ANCHOR, KEY, LAMP, COFFEE, HONEY, SALT, APPLE\nClue: KEYS (4)\nReasoning: Things with keys: PIANO has piano keys, KEY is literally a key, CLOCK can have winding keys, BELL could be a stretch. COMPASS and TELESCOPE don't relate to keys. Go confident with 4.\n→ Guesses: KEY, PIANO, CLOCK, BELL\n\n**Example 3:**\nBoard: ALBUM, CASTLE, SONG, DANCE, ROCK, JAZZ, STONE, MUSIC, CONCERT, QUEEN, KING, KINGDOM, CHAMPION, FORTRESS, KNIGHT, PIANO\nClue: CHESS (4)\nReasoning: Chess pieces and moves: KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT are chess pieces. CASTLE refers to castling, a fundamental chess move. All four are direct, unambiguous chess associations.\n→ Guesses: KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT, CASTLE\n\n**Example 4 (Learning from mistakes):**\nBoard: VAMPIRE, FISH, FROG, SNAKE, DRAGON, TIGER, WOLF, JUNGLE, OCTOPUS, RABBIT, DINOSAUR, TURTLE, ELEPHANT, WEREWOLF, BEAR, LION\nClue: PAWS (6)\nReasoning: Animals with paws - TIGER, WOLF, BEAR, LION, RABBIT are clear quadrupeds with paws. ELEPHANT has feet/pads but \"paws\" is not standard for large animals. WEREWOLF and DINOSAUR are mythical/extinct and ambiguous. Rather than risk bystanders, stick with the 5 most direct matches.\n→ Guesses: TIGER, WOLF, BEAR, LION, RABBIT\n(Note: This was underperformance - the game expected 6 words. A 6th confident match should have been found if possible, or the reasoning should have been more thorough in searching the board.)\n\n**Example 5 (Learning from mistakes):**\nBoard: BONE, BRAIN, CIVILIZATION, MUSCLE, ANCIENT, SHOULDER, MODERN, EMPIRE, NECK, BLOOD, MEDIEVAL, NERVE, SKULL, ROME, CENTURY, TOOTH\nClue: CAESAR (3)\nReasoning: Direct Caesar associations - ROME is where Caesar ruled. EMPIRE is what he built. But ANCIENT is too indirect - Caesar lived in ancient times, but \"ancient\" is a general descriptor, not a direct Caesar association. Better to guess only ROME and EMPIRE with high confidence, or find a third direct association like a specific work or title.\n→ Guesses: ROME, EMPIRE\n(Note: ANCIENT was a bystander - avoid temporal descriptors unless they are explicit era names matching the clue)\n\n**Example 6:**\nBoard: FROG, COLLAR, DRAGON, THUNDER, SNAKE, UNIFORM, TIE, NECK, CAVE, DINOSAUR, ELEPHANT, EYE, TURTLE, SALT, GLASSES, LIGHTNING\nClue: WEAR (4)\nReasoning: Things you wear - COLLAR, TIE, UNIFORM, and GLASSES are all items of clothing or accessories that people wear on their bodies. These are direct, unambiguous matches. NECK is a body part, not something you wear. Animals and weather phenomena are not wearable.\n→ Guesses: COLLAR, TIE, UNIFORM, GLASSES\n\n**Example 7 (Learning from mistakes - HOPPING):**\nBoard: DEATH, DINOSAUR, RABBIT, ELEPHANT, DEFEAT, FROG, LOVE, FISH, LIFE, TIGER, BEAR, SNAKE, HEART, OCTOPUS, TURTLE, DRAGON\nClue: HOPPING (2)\nReasoning: Animals that hop as their primary mode of locomotion - RABBIT and FROG are quintessential hoppers. These are the only two animals on the board with hopping as a primary, unambiguous characteristic. Other animals (TIGER, BEAR, ELEPHANT, SNAKE, TURTLE, OCTOPUS) do not hop. Mythical creatures (DRAGON, DINOSAUR) are ambiguous.\n→ Guesses: RABBIT, FROG\n(Note: This was successful - stick with direct, unambiguous associations for animal behavior clues)\n\n**Example 8 (Learning from mistakes - LINK):**\nBoard: JEWELRY, IRON, MOON, CHAIN, GALAXY, STONE, EARTH, ALIEN, GOLD, RING, DIAMOND, OCEAN, MAGNET, PHONE, PLANET, MEDAL\nClue: LINK (2)\nReasoning: Direct link associations - CHAIN is the most direct association (chains are fundamentally made of links). RING has multiple interpretations (jewelry, circular shape, linking function) and is riskier as a bystander. Prefer CHAIN with high confidence. For a second word, look for other unambiguous link associations rather than RING.\n→ Guesses: CHAIN\n(Note: RING was risky due to multiple interpretations. Better to stop at 1 confident guess than risk a bystander penalty.)\n\n**Example 9 (Learning from mistakes - POLES):**\nBoard: EARTH, MOSCOW, SEATTLE, BOSTON, PLANET, FILM, HOLLYWOOD, OCEAN, THEATER, LONDON, MAGNET, ALIEN, BERLIN, TOKYO, CAPITAL\nClue: POLES (3)\nReasoning: Direct pole associations - EARTH has geographic poles (North and South). MAGNET has magnetic poles. PLANET seems like it should work (planets have poles), but it's often a bystander because \"planet\" is too generic/conceptual and has broader meanings. Stick with EARTH and MAGNET as the most confident matches.\n→ Guesses: EARTH, MAGNET\n(Note: PLANET was a bystander. Avoid abstract/conceptual words for concrete clues.)\n\n**Example 10 (Learning from mistakes - HISTORY):**\nBoard: BUTTER, COMPUTER, WATER, BOTTLE, MONUMENT, MEDIEVAL, APPLE, CHOCOLATE, RUINS, MILK, ONION, VIKING, CHEESE, LEMON, ANCIENT, TEMPLE\nClue: HISTORY (4)\nReasoning: Direct history associations - VIKING is a specific historical civilization (safe). MEDIEVAL and ANCIENT are temporal descriptors that are frequently bystanders despite seeming like direct associations - avoid them. MONUMENT, RUINS, and TEMPLE are abstract historical concepts with broader meanings and are often bystanders. The safest approach is to guess only VIKING with high confidence, or look for other specific historical civilizations/peoples on the board.\n→ Guesses: VIKING\n(Note: ANCIENT was a bystander. MEDIEVAL, MONUMENT, RUINS, and TEMPLE are risky. Temporal descriptors and abstract historical concepts are frequently bystanders for \"HISTORY\" clues.)\n\n**Example 11 (Learning from mistakes - PULSE):**\nBoard: TEAM, EARTH, LOVE, COMPANY, MARKET, OFFICE, PRICE, HEART, WAREHOUSE, SALE, BRAND, FACTORY, DEFEAT, STOCK, LIFE, DEATH\nClue: PULSE (8)\nReasoning: Direct pulse associations - HEART is the organ that produces a pulse (most direct). LIFE indicates vitality/pulse. However, metaphorical business jargon associations like MARKET (\"market pulse\"), COMPANY (\"company pulse\"), BRAND (\"brand pulse\"), STOCK (\"stock pulse\"), OFFICE (\"office pulse\"), and SALE (\"sales pulse\") are risky. These metaphorical extensions are frequently bystanders. Stick with literal, primary associations: HEART and LIFE are safe. Other words on the board (TEAM, EARTH, LOVE, PRICE, WAREHOUSE, FACTORY, DEFEAT, DEATH) do not have clear pulse associations. Better to guess only the 2 most confident words (HEART, LIFE) rather than risk bystander penalties on metaphorical business jargon.\n→ Guesses: HEART, LIFE\n(Note: Metaphorical business jargon associations are frequently bystanders. Avoid them unless they are the primary, literal meaning of the word.)\n\n**Example 12 (Learning from mistakes - ORBIT):**\nBoard: FAILURE, CIRCUIT, SUCCESS, MISSILE, MOUSE, VICTORY, PRICE, WIRE, COMPANY, DEAL, TREASURE, ROCKET, SALE, PROGRESS, BRAND, SATELLITE\nClue: ORBIT (2)\nReasoning: Direct orbit associations - SATELLITE is the most direct association (satellites orbit celestial bodies). For a second word, ROCKET is indirect (rockets launch things into orbit but don't themselves orbit). CIRCUIT could metaphorically relate to orbiting (a circuit is a path/loop), but this is too abstract and risky. MISSILE is also indirect. The only clear, direct association is SATELLITE. Since I cannot confidently identify a second word without significant risk, I should guess only SATELLITE rather than risk a bystander penalty.\n→ Guesses: SATELLITE\n(Note: ROCKET and CIRCUIT are too indirect. Better to stop at 1 confident guess than risk a bystander penalty on an uncertain second word.)\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT GAME\n\n**Available Words (unrevealed):** {{AVAILABLE_WORDS}}\n\n**Board Layout:**\n{{BOARD}}\n\n**Current Clue:** {{CLUE}} ({{NUMBER}})\n\n**List your guesses, one word per line.
