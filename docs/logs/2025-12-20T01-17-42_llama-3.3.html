Specifically, PARMESAN, NEAPOLITAN, BOLOGNESE, and VENETIAN could all be related to Italian cuisine or styles or places associated with food. This connection seems strong because all these words have direct references to either types of cheese, sauces, or culinary styles that originate from Italy or are named after Italian places.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Considering the words WORD, POOL, WHISK, and BEAT, I notice that these words could be related to activities or objects associated with games or leisure. However, a stronger connection seems to be between WORD and other words that could be related to language or writing, but since I need a group of four, I'll look for a different angle. The words POOL, WHISK, and BEAT could be related to mixing or blending, especially in the context of cooking or bartending, but WORD doesn't fit well here. Another possible connection could be between words that have multiple meanings or uses. For example, POOL can refer to a body of water or a game, WHISK can be a kitchen tool or a verb meaning to move quickly, BEAT can refer to a rhythm or to defeat someone, and WORD can have various meanings depending on the context. However, this connection seems a bit stretched. A more promising connection might be between words that are related to hair color or styles, given the presence of BLONDE and BLACK, but I've already explored color-related categories. Upon reevaluation, I notice that WHISK, BEAT, WHIP, and MIX (if it were available) could all be related to actions or tools used in cooking or baking. Since MIX is not available, I might consider words that are closely related to these actions. Given the available words, I'll consider a different approach: looking for words that could be related to each other through a common theme or action in a different context. The presence of WORD suggests a potential connection to language or writing, but combining it with other words to form a coherent group has proven challenging. Considering alternative connections, I notice that some words could be related to each other through their opposites or contrasts. For instance, BLACK and BLONDE could be opposites in terms of hair color, but I need two more words to fit this category. Another possible connection could be between words that have a strong association with each other in a specific context, such as cooking (WHISK, WHIP, BEAT) or colors (BLACK, BLONDE, and potentially others). However, since I need to find a connection that includes four words, I'll have to think more broadly. Upon further consideration, I realize that I might have overlooked a simpler connection between words that are related to each other through their meanings or associations. For example, WORD could be related to language, and POOL could be related to a collection or gathering, which might not be directly connected. Given the diversity of the words, my next guess will require a bit of lateral thinking to find a category that might not be immediately obvious.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

However, these words seem somewhat disparate, and finding a category that fits all of them perfectly is challenging. Another approach is to consider words that could be related to travel or leisure (CRUISE, HOTEL, LODGE, REMOTE could be a stretch as in remote locations). Since I've already used some words and need to find a category that fits four unused words, I'll consider a broader category that could encompass words like CRUISE, HOTEL, and other unused words.

Another approach is to look at the words ASTROTURF, RUSHMORE, CREAMSICLE, and JOURNEYMAN. Among these, ASTROTURF is a type of artificial turf used in sports, RUSHMORE could refer to Mount Rushmore, CREAMSICLE is a type of frozen treat, and JOURNEYMAN refers to a skilled worker who has completed an apprenticeship. However, considering the previous correct categories were quite specific (photography and Italian cuisine), I should look for a category that is similarly specific. Noticing that some of these words could be related to "names of things that are artificially made or constructed," I consider ASTROTURF as a key word here, but it's a bit of a stretch to connect all these words under a single, coherent category without more obvious links. Given the diversity, I might need to think about brand names, types of products, or other specific categories that could fit. Since my previous guess was incorrect and I need to be more precise, I'll consider another angle: looking for words that could be related to "types of surfaces or grounds" or another category that might fit more neatly. However, without a clear connection, my next guess might require a bit of a leap.

Another potential category could be "words that can be related to shapes or objects with specific shapes," which might include TOKEN (can be a shape), STICK (linear shape), WEDGE (a specific geometric shape), and CRUISE doesn't fit well here. Considering the words more abstractly, I notice that TOKEN, STICK, and WEDGE could all be related to "objects that can be held in one's hand," which is a more tangible category. CRUISE, however, does not fit this category well. Upon further reflection, a category that might encompass a different set of words could be "words related to types of controls or devices," which could include TOKEN (as in a token for access), REMOTE (a remote control), STICK (as in a joystick), and CRUISE (as in cruise control).

Although my earlier guess with these words was incorrect, I believe the connection is strong, and the issue might have been with the category's specificity or the inclusion of words that don't perfectly fit. Given the pressure to make a correct guess, I will reconsider the sports-related words and think about how they might fit into a more specific category. Perhaps the category is not just "sports venues" but something more precise, like "features found in baseball stadiums" or "aspects of the viewing experience in sports."
